# Installation

You don't have to install Rust to try the examples in this book! You can use
the built-in editor right in your web browser.

However, not *every* example works on the web. And you might prefer following
along on your computer, in your editor, rather than in a web browser. In that
case, you'll want to install Rust.

The best way to get instructions for installing Rust is to visit [the Rust
installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) on the Rust
website. Since most people will be using RBE on the web, that's all we'll
get into this for now; check out [The
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html)
if you'd like something more in-depth.
