# Introduction

Welcome to “The Rust Programming Language,” a collection of runnable examples
that illustrate various Rust concepts.

Rust is a programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable
software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds with
each other in programming language design; Rust stands to challenge that.
Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer
experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as
memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such
control.
