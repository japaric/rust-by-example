# Rust by Example

[Rust][rust] is a programming language with a focus on
type safety, memory safety, concurrency and performance.

This book is a collection of bitesize examples that illustrate various rustic
concepts and the Rust distribution libraries.

Be sure to have rust [installed][install] and the
[docs][std] at hand, let's
start!

*Note*: This book will follow the nightly version of Rust until we reach
version 1.0, it's highly possible that some examples won't work with snapshot
version like 0.10, be sure to use a nightly version!
