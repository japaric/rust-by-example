`match` is a valid method for handling `Option`s. However, you may 
eventually find heavy usage tedious, especially with operations only valid 
with an input. In these cases, [combinators][combinators] can be used to 
manage control flow in a modular fashion.

`Option` has a built in method called `map()`, a combinator for the simple 
mapping of `Some -> Some` and `None -> None`. Multiple `map()` calls can be 
chained together for even more flexibility.

In the following example, `process()` replaces all functions previous
to it while staying compact.

{map.play}
