`map()` was described as a chainable way to simplify `match` statements. 
However, using `map()` on a function that returns an `Option<T>` results 
in the nested `Option<Option<T>>`. Chaining multiple calls together can 
then become confusing. That's where another combinator called `and_then()`, 
known in some languages as flatmap, comes in.

`and_then()` calls its function input with the wrapped value and returns the result. If the `Option` is `None`, then it returns `None` instead.

In the following example, `cookable_v2()` results in an `Option<Food>`. 
Using `map()` instead of `and_then()` would have given an 
`Option<Option<Food>>`, which is an invalid type for `eat()`.
